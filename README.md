# Hej, I'm Alexey Ses

Hi there! I'm a frontend developer based in the Netherlands. 

## About me

Frontend development is my passion. I started with jQuery, then moved to create SPAs with AngularJS, and then finally modern Angular. I built from scratch one project for a company based in Hungary and supported multiple projects for companies from Kazakhstan, Belarus and Netherlands. I've been a mentor for junior frontend devs a couple of times. I consider myself a team player who is ready to help any of my teammates. Besides frontend, I learn Java and Spring Boot framework now in order to be a full-stack developer. 

My hobbies are reading everything UI-related, traveling to distant countries, running in my awesome neighborhood in Rotterdam. Also, I love to travel to random Dutch cities/villages on the train, rent a bicycle there and explore the place. Btw I moved to the Netherlands at the end of 2021 so there are plenty of places for me to explore.
